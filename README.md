# Deno Starter Template

This is a generic Deno template used to build out Slack apps using the Slack
CLI.

Before getting started, make sure you have a development workspace where you
have permissions to install apps. If you donâ€™t have one set up, go ahead and
[create one](https://slack.com/create).

## Setup

### Install the Slack CLI

To use this template, you first need to install and configure the Slack CLI.
Step-by-step instructions can be found in our
[Quickstart Guide](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

## Running Your Project Locally

While building your app, you can see your changes propagated to your workspace
in real-time with `slack run`. You'll know an app is the development version
because the name has the string `(dev)` appended.

```zsh
# Clone this project onto your machine
$ slack create my-app -t slack-samples/deno-hello-world

# Change into this project directory
$ cd my-app

# Run app locally
$ slack run

Connected, awaiting events
```

## Testing

For an example of how to test a function, see
`functions/sample_function_test.ts`. Test filenames should be suffixed with
`_test`.

Run all tests with `deno test`:

```zsh
$ deno test
```

## Deploying Your App

When you're done with development, you can deploy your app to a production
workspace using `slack deploy`:

```zsh
$ slack deploy
```

## Project Structure

### `manifest.ts`

The [app manifest](https://api.slack.com/future/manifest) contains the app's
configuration. This file defines attributes like app name and description.

### `slack.json`

Used by the CLI to interact with the project's SDK dependencies. It contains
script hooks that are executed by the CLI and implemented by the SDK.

### `/functions`

[Functions](https://api.slack.com/future/functions) are reusable building blocks
of automation that accept inputs, perform calculations, and provide outputs.
Functions can be used independently or as steps in Workflows.

### `/workflows`

A [Workflow](https://api.slack.com/future/workflows) is a set of steps that are
executed in order. Each step in a Workflow is a function.

Workflows can be configured to run without user input or they can wait for input
via form before continuing to the next step.

### `/triggers`

[Triggers](https://api.slack.com/future/triggers) determine when Workflows are
executed. A trigger file describes a scenario in which a workflow should be run,
such as a user pressing a button or when a specific event occurs.
